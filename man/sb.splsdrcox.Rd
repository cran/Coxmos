\description{
This function performs a single-block sparse partial least squares deviance residual
Cox (SB.sPLS-DRCOX-Dynamic). The function returns a Coxmos model with the attribute model as "SB.sPLS-DRCOX-Dynamic".
}
\details{
The \code{SB.sPLS-DRCOX-Dynamic} function performs a single-block sparse partial least squares deviance residual
Cox analysis. This method is designed to handle datasets with a single block of explanatory variables
and aims to identify the most relevant features that contribute to the survival outcome. The method
combines the strengths of sparse partial least squares (sPLS) with Cox regression, allowing for
dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and survival analysis in a unified framework.

The key feature of this function is the use of deviance residuals as the response in the sPLS model.
Deviance residuals are derived from a preliminary Cox model and capture the discrepancies between
the observed and expected number of events. By using these residuals as the response, the sPLS model
can focus on identifying the explanatory variables that have the most significant impact on the
survival outcome.

The function offers flexibility in specifying various hyperparameters, such as the number of latent
components (\code{n.comp}) and the penalty for variable selection (\code{penalty}). The penalty parameter, \code{penalty},
controls the sparsity of the model, with higher values leading to more variables being excluded from
the model. This allows for a balance between model complexity and interpretability.

Data preprocessing options, such as centering and scaling of the explanatory variables and removal
of near-zero variance variables, are also provided. These preprocessing steps ensure that the data
is in a suitable format for the sPLS model and can help improve the stability and performance of
the analysis.

The output of the function provides a comprehensive overview of the sPLS-DRCOX model, including the
normalized data, PLS weights and scores, and the final Cox model. Visualization tools and metrics
such as AIC and BIC are also provided to aid in understanding the model's performance and
significance of the selected features.

In summary, the \code{SB.sPLS-DRCOX-Dynamic} function offers a robust approach for survival analysis with
high-dimensional data, combining feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and Cox regression
in a single-block framework. The method is particularly useful for datasets where the number of
variables exceeds the number of observations, and there's a need to identify the most relevant
features for predicting survival outcomes.
