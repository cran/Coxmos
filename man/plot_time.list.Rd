\title{Time consuming plot.}
\usage{
plot_time.list(lst_models, x.text = "Method", y.text = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{lst_models}{List of Coxmos models. Each Coxmos object has the attribute time measured in
minutes (cross-validation models could be also added to this function).}

\item{x.text}{Character. X axis title.}

\item{y.text}{Character. Y axis title. If y.text = NULL, then y.text = "Time (mins)" (default: NULL).}
}
\value{
A 'ggplot2' bar plot object.
}
\description{
Produces a visual representation, using ggplot2, of the computational time consumed
by each model encapsulated within the provided list of Coxmos models. This visualization aids in
the comparative assessment of computational efficiency across different models.
}
\details{
The \code{plot_time.list} function objective is to offer a clear and concise visual
representation of the computational time expended by each model during its execution.

The function expects a list of Coxmos models, each of which should inherently possess a time
attribute indicating the computational time it consumed. This time attribute is then extracted,
aggregated, and visualized in a bar plot format. The function is versatile enough to handle both
individual models and cross-validation models, summing up the computational times in the latter
case to provide an aggregate view.

The resultant plot is generated using the 'ggplot2' package, ensuring a high-quality and interpretable
visualization. The Y-axis of the plot represents the computational time, typically in minutes, while
the X-axis enumerates the different models. The function also offers customization options for axis
labels, ensuring that the resultant plot aligns with the user's preferences and the intended audience's
expectations.
