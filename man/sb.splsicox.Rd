\description{
This function performs a single-block sparse partial least squares individual Cox
(SB.sPLS-ICOX). The function returns a Coxmos model with the attribute model as "SB.sPLS-ICOX".
}
\details{
The \code{SB.sPLS-ICOX} function is designed to perform a single-block sparse partial least squares
individual Cox analysis. This method is particularly suited for high-dimensional datasets where
the number of variables (features) significantly exceeds the number of observations. The
"single-block" in its name indicates that while the function can handle datasets with multiple
blocks, it processes each block individually rather than in a multiblock manner where all blocks
are analyzed simultaneously.

By analyzing one block at a time, the function ensures a focused and detailed examination of each
block's contribution to the survival outcome. This approach is especially beneficial when different
blocks represent distinct types or sources of data, allowing for a granular understanding of each
block's significance.

The analysis begins by applying a penalty to select significant variables based on individual Cox
models. This step ensures that only the most relevant features from the current block contribute
to the subsequent sPLS analysis. The sPLS method then identifies latent components that capture
the maximum covariance between the explanatory variables (X) from the block and the response (Y),
which are the deviance residuals from the Cox models.

Users have the flexibility to specify various hyperparameters, including the number of latent
components and the penalty for variable selection. The function also offers options for data
preprocessing, such as centering, scaling, and removing variables with near-zero or zero variance.

The output provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis for the processed block, including
normalized data information, survival model details, and the sPLS-ICOX model. Visualization tools
and metrics such as AIC and BIC further aid in understanding the model's performance and
significance for the given block.

In summary, the \code{SB.sPLS-ICOX} function offers a powerful approach for survival analysis in
high-dimensional settings, ensuring optimal feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and
predictive modeling for each individual block in the dataset.
